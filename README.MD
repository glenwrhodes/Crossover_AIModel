owered Recommendation Engine

## Overview
This project implements an AI-powered recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform using collaborative filtering (SVD). It includes data preprocessing, model training, and a Flask web application to provide personalized product recommendations.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and dataset cleaning.
- **Model Training**: Uses SVD with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- **Caching**: Uses Flask-Caching for low-latency responses.
- **Logging**: Logs request handling and performance metrics.
- **Feedback Collection**: Collects user feedback for continuous model evaluation.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/recommendation-engine.git
    cd crossover_aimodel
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Train the Model**:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

4. **Run the Flask Application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
- Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
- Select a user to view personalized recommendations.
- Provide feedback on recommendations.

## Continuous Evaluation
- **Logging**: Logs are stored in `app.log`.
- **Feedback**: User feedback is stored in `feedback.csv`.

## Scalability and Performance
- **Caching**: Uses Flask-Caching for low-latency responses.

## Evaluation and Optimization
- **Cross-Validation**: Uses `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Incremental Updates**: Collects feedback for continuous model improvement.

## Hosted Application
The application is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed here: [https://aimodel-46057b6afcc5.herokuapp.com/]
